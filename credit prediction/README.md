# 📈 Customer Attrition Analysis in Credit Card Portfolio

This project focuses on analyzing customer attrition in a credit card portfolio and predicting which customers are likely to churn.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The analysis is performed using a dataset available on Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers).

## 🔍 Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including mapping categorical values, one-hot encoding, and dropping irrelevant columns.
- **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation study is performed to identify the most relevant features related to customer attrition.
- **Model Building**: Various classification models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are trained to predict customer churn.

## 📊 Key Metrics

The models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A comparative analysis of these metrics is performed to identify the best-performing model.

## 📉 Results Visualization

The F1 scores of different models are visualized in a bar plot for a clear comparison.

## 🧐 Observations

- The RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers show promising results.
- The F1 score is used as the key metric due to the balanced focus on precision and recall.

## 💻 Usage

The analysis is done using Python, with packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.
